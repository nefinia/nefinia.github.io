  <h1>The Drifting Mediator</h1>
  <h2>Type Code: ZOTEFAKO</h2>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> You’re a thinker who follow ideas wherever they lead, and prefer clear, linear steps. You seek intense sensory experiences, and learn best through physical engagement. You tend to express your emotions openly, and feel cautious in social interactions. You have a fluctuating attention span — but prefer structure and clear outcomes to ground your path. You flow between emotion and structure with ease.</p>
  <p><strong>How You Learn Best:</strong> You thrive on exploring open ideas and creative connections. You prefer logical, sequential steps to build understanding. You benefit from stimulating environments with rich sensory input. You learn best when physically engaging with material. You connect to learning through expressive, emotional channels. You learn best in safe, familiar settings with fewer people. You focus in bursts; flexible scheduling supports you. You excel when tasks are clearly defined with fixed structure.</p>
  <p><strong>Practical Tips:</strong> Experiment with brainstorming, mind mapping, and nonlinear tools. Follow logical outlines and procedural tutorials step-by-step. Engage in interactive environments with sound, touch, or movement. Practice through hands-on tasks, demos, or movement-based learning. Incorporate journaling, emotional storytelling, or expressive projects. Keep learning private and self-paced in secure, quiet settings. Use time-boxing apps or short bursts with variety between topics. Use planners or task managers to keep everything orderly.</p>
