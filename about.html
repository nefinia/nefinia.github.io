                  <h3>Scientist</h3>
                  <p>
                    I am a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics, specializing in galaxy evolution, gas dynamics, and AGN feedback 
                    within high-redshift protoclusters (z~2). My work bridges theoretical and observational astrophysics, 
                    combining integral field spectroscopy (IFS) and high-resolution imaging to explore the interplay between galaxies 
                    and their environment in the early universe. I am highly interested in outreach and interdisciplinary collaborations, 
                    seeking to connect astronomy with broader cultural, educational, and scientific contexts.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Research Journey</h4>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bachelor’s Research:</strong> My research journey began in Chile, where I studied the galactic center, 
                    analyzing the inflow of gas into the inner Milky Way using hydrodynamical simulations to understand the impact of 
                    a satellite galaxy merger on star formation.</li>

                    <li><strong>Master’s Research:</strong> I shifted to cosmic large-scale structure, working on 
                    detecting galaxy clusters using the red-sequence technique in the CFHTLS/VIPERS surveys. This research focused 
                    on characterizing the optical properties of clusters and estimating their optical richness as a mass proxy.</li>

                    <li><strong>Ph.D. Research (ETH Zurich):</strong> My doctoral research at ETH Zurich centered on the 
                    Circumgalactic and Intergalactic Medium (CGM/IGM), studying the connection between galaxies and the cosmic web. 
                    I used MUSE data to investigate the Cosmic Ultraviolet Background (UVB), placing constraints on its intensity 
                    around Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies, with support from cosmological simulations.</li>

                    <li><strong>Postdoctoral Research (Caltech & Université Paris Cité):</strong> Currently, my work focuses on 
                    protocluster environments at Cosmic Noon (z~2), using KCWI and HST data to explore gas kinematics, AGN-driven 
                    outflows, and the onset of intracluster light (ICL). I collaborate with Emanuele Daddi and other researchers in 
                    extragalactic astronomy to study how these early structures form and evolve.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    My expertise includes data analysis, image and signal processing, and numerical simulations, 
                    integrating self-developed software with specialized astronomical tools. My work is deeply interdisciplinary, 
                    engaging with cosmology, large-scale structure, and high-energy astrophysics, while also incorporating public outreach 
                    into my scientific career.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Artist</h3>
                  <p>
                    As a singer and actress, I have performed in musicals, operas, and plays since childhood. In 2007, I participated 
                    in an international choral festival in Tarragona, Spain with the University choir. As a violinist, I toured Europe 
                    with my school orchestra and competed in a national violin contest in 2001. Over the years, I have performed with 
                    the Universidad de La Serena Symphonic Orchestra, the university orchestra in Santiago, and various ensembles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2011, my musical group "Magreb" released the album "Música Andalusí", sponsored by the Embassy of Morocco in Chile.
                    Between 2009 and 2011, I studied lyric singing at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, balancing my studies with my 
                    bachelor’s in astronomy. From 2009 to 2015, I worked as a professional singer and violinist, performing at corporate 
                    and private events to finance my education.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During my Ph.D. at ETH Zurich, I joined a student band and performed at various events. In 2019, I founded my own amateur 
                    musical theater company, "ZIMT", and in 2021, I launched the YouTube channel "Cosmosofia", blending science with storytelling.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Cosmic Ventures</h3>
                  <p>
                      I use my diverse skills to develop new ideas that improve science communication, education, and sustainability. My ventures 
                      merge astronomy, culture, and education, making complex scientific concepts more accessible to the public.
                  </p>

                      <li><strong>Transdisciplinary Conversations:</strong> While at Caltech, I co-organized Transdisciplinary Conversations, 
                      a platform that brought together scientists, artists, and scholars from different disciplines to discuss common challenges, 
                      methods, and inspirations. Many of these discussions are available on the

                      <li><strong>Cosmotourism:</strong> In 2020, I founded "Urania", introducing the concept of Cosmotourism, which combines astronomical 
                      tourism, sustainable accommodation, and the promotion of local heritage. The first Cosmotourism center is planned for the Elqui Valley, Chile.</li>
                  
                      <li><strong>Astronomy-based Board Game:</strong> I am currently developing an educational board game that blends science, strategy, 
                      and storytelling, making astronomy more engaging and interactive.</li>
                  
                      <li><strong>Public Speaking & Competitions:</strong> In 2024, I was a Finalist in the International Pitch Competition at Cité Internationale 
                      Universitaire de Paris, presenting my work in science outreach and interdisciplinary projects.</li>
                  
                      <li><strong>Casa Rota:</strong> In 2021, I founded <a href="http://casarota.cl" target="_blank">"Casa Rota"</a>,
