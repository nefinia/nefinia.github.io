    <h3>Research Journey</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bachelor’s Research:</strong>  
    My undergraduate research focused on the dynamics of gas inflow into the inner ~200 pc of the Milky Way, 
    analyzing how a satellite galaxy merger perturbs the gas distribution in the Galactic Center. Using 
    hydrodynamical simulations, I studied how gas is funneled toward the central region, leading to 
    possible star formation and activity near the supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*.  
    This work contributed to understanding the role of minor mergers in fueling central black holes 
    and shaping the Milky Way’s inner structure.  

    I continued working on this topic during my Master’s research, refining the dynamical models 
    and incorporating additional simulation constraints. This effort led to a published paper in 
    MNRAS Letters, providing key insights into how satellite galaxy infall influences gas dynamics 
    in the Galactic Center (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article/467/1/L41/2720999?login=false" target="_blank">MNRAS Paper</a>).
  </li>

  <li><strong>Master’s Research:</strong>  
    My research thesis focused on detecting galaxy clusters using the red-sequence technique in the 
    CFHTLS/VIPERS surveys, characterizing their optical properties and estimating cluster masses via 
    optical richness (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015IAUGA..2258049G/abstract" target="_blank">Master’s Thesis</a>).  
    This work refined photometric cluster detection methods and provided constraints on the mass distribution 
    of galaxy clusters at intermediate redshifts.  

    In addition to my thesis, I worked on a small project where I developed my own radiative transfer code 
    to simulate supernova (SNe) polarization, investigating how asymmetries in the explosion mechanism and 
    dust scattering affect observed polarization signals ([Link]). This allowed for a deeper understanding 
    of how explosion geometry influences SNe light curves and polarization profiles.  

    Additionally, I completed a semester project analyzing tidal tails in globular clusters, identifying stellar streams 
    to help model the Galactic center potential. This work contributed to understanding how globular clusters 
    dynamically interact with the Milky Way's gravitational field, providing insights into both the evolution 
    of clusters and the underlying mass distribution of the Galactic center.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Ph.D. Research (ETH Zurich):</strong>  
    My main focus during my Ph.D. at ETH Zurich was unveiling the properties of the cosmic web 
    through Lyman-alpha emission. To achieve this, I developed a specialized stacking technique 
    aligning MUSE integral field spectroscopy observations of Lyman-alpha emitters to detect 
    the faint filamentary structures of the cosmic web in emission for the first time.  

    This method provided new observational evidence of large-scale intergalactic gas distribution, 
    allowing for a direct connection between galaxies and their surrounding environment.  
    Building on this detection, I then used the same data to constrain the intensity of the 
    Cosmic Ultraviolet Background (UVB) in low-density regions of the cosmic web, placing new 
    limits on how extragalactic ionizing radiation regulates intergalactic gas properties.  

    My work bridged the gap between theoretical predictions and observational constraints on 
    cosmic web emission, revealing key insights into how diffuse intergalactic gas is ionized, 
    distributed, and connected to galaxy evolution in the early universe.  
    (<a href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/474618?show=full" target="_blank">Ph.D. Thesis</a>).
  </li>
  <li><strong>Postdoctoral Research (Caltech):</strong>  
    At Caltech, I studied a high-redshift (z=2.3) protocluster system using KCWI integral field 
    spectroscopy, uncovering multiple extended Lyα halos surrounding galaxies in a dense environment.  
    My research provided new evidence of AGN-driven outflows and enhanced star formation within 
    overdense regions of the cosmic web.  

    I integrated multiwavelength datasets (ALMA, HST, Spitzer, Chandra) to probe the interplay between 
    gas kinematics, galaxy evolution, and AGN-driven processes. My findings contributed to understanding 
    how feedback from supermassive black holes influences galaxy growth in the early universe, 
    particularly in environments that will evolve into massive clusters by z=0.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Postdoctoral Research (Université Paris Cité):</strong>  
    Currently, I am investigating several protoclusters from the CARLA survey, a sample of high-redshift 
    structures centered on radio-loud AGNs. My research focuses on gas kinematics, AGN-driven outflows, 
    and the emergence of intracluster light (ICL), key components in understanding cluster formation at 
    Cosmic Noon (z~2).  

    By combining HST, KCWI, and multiwavelength observations, I am examining how dense environments 
    shape galaxy evolution and trigger enhanced AGN activity. My work contributes to characterizing 
    early-stage cluster formation, identifying mechanisms that regulate star formation and gas accretion 
    in the progenitors of today’s massive galaxy clusters.
