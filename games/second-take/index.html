  <h1>SECOND TAKE</h1>
  <p>
    A game for replaying difficult moments  
    and exploring how situations might unfold differently.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Second Take</strong> is a conversation and rehearsal game.
      Players act out short, realistic situations where something is already
      slightly wrong — uncomfortable, unfair, or unresolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene is played once as written.
      Then the group pauses.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the pause, players propose different ways the situation
      could be handled.
      The scene is replayed with those changes,
      and the group reflects on what shifted — and what did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no winning or losing.
      The point is to make power, risk, and agency visible.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>What you need to play</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3–8 players</li>
      <li>One shared space (physical or videocall)</li>
      <li>One player acting as <strong>Director</strong></li>
      <li>Each player opens <strong>user.html</strong> on their own device</li>
      <li>Willingness to pause, replay, and discuss</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>The cards</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Situation cards</strong> describe a context, roles, and a baseline tension.
      They define what is already happening before anyone intervenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Reaction cards</strong> describe possible actions or responses.
      They are always visible and can be proposed by anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Feedback cards</strong> describe how the replay is interpreted.
      They are used to support discussion, not to judge outcomes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>Game flow</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The Director selects or generates a <strong>Situation</strong></li>
      <li>Roles from the situation are assigned to players</li>
      <li>The scene is played once, following the baseline tension</li>
      <li>The Director calls a <strong>pause</strong></li>
      <li>Anyone may propose one or more <strong>Reaction cards</strong></li>
      <li>The Director chooses which reactions will be tried</li>
      <li>The scene is replayed with those changes</li>
      <li>All players point to one or more <strong>Feedback cards</strong></li>
      <li>The group discusses what changed, what stayed the same, and why</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>Important principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reactions propose actions, not solutions</li>
      <li>Feedback cards describe effects, not success or failure</li>
      <li>Multiple interpretations are allowed to coexist</li>
      <li>Silence, exit, or inaction are valid responses</li>
      <li>The Director may adapt or stop a scene for safety</li>
      <li>Conversation matters more than performance</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>Ready?</h2>
